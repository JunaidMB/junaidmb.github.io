Hi! My name is Junaid, and I'm a **Machine Learning Software Engineer** ðŸ¤–. I majored in **Software Design and Development** and I have minors in both **Computer Science** and **Environmental Science**.

I have a heavy passion for **Deep Learning** and **Open Source** libraries. As a result, below you will find some notable articles I've written, a few courses I've made, some of software libraries I've written, interesting projects, and the open source libraries I have tried to contribute the most to.
