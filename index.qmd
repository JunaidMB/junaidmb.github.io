Hello there! My name is Junaid and I've worn many hats, most notably **Research Engineer**, **Data Scientist** and **Machine Learning Engineer**. I'm interested in Machine Learning, Statistics and Computer Science. 
My academic background is in Computational Statistics and Data Science. I've created this blog to catalogue the things I'm learning as I build cool things.
