# Machine Learning Basics

## Introduction

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms that can learn and make decisions from data.

## Key Concepts

### Supervised Learning
- **Definition**: Learning with labeled training data
- **Examples**: Classification, Regression
- **Algorithms**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machines

### Unsupervised Learning
- **Definition**: Learning patterns from unlabeled data
- **Examples**: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
- **Algorithms**:
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Hierarchical Clustering
  - PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

### Reinforcement Learning
- **Definition**: Learning through interaction with environment
- **Examples**: Game playing, Robot navigation
- **Key concepts**: Agent, Environment, Reward, Policy

## Model Evaluation

### Cross-Validation
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# 5-fold cross-validation
scores = cross_val_score(RandomForestClassifier(), X, y, cv=5)
print(f"Average accuracy: {scores.mean():.3f}")
```

### Metrics
- **Classification**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- **Regression**: MSE, RMSE, MAE, RÂ²

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Overfitting**: Model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
2. **Underfitting**: Model is too simple to capture underlying patterns
3. **Data Leakage**: Using future information to predict the past
4. **Biased Data**: Training data not representative of real-world scenarios
