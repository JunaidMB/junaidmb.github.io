## Hello World!

Welcome to my new Quarto blog! I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts, projects, and learnings here.

## What is Quarto?

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is an amazing publishing system that allows you to create beautiful documents, websites, and blogs using markdown, code, and more. It supports multiple programming languages including Python, R, Julia, and Observable JavaScript.

## What to Expect

In future posts, I'll be sharing:

- Technical tutorials and tips
- Project showcases
- Personal reflections on technology and learning
- Code examples and experiments

## Code Example

Here's a simple example of what you can do with Quarto:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Generate some sample data
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

# Create a plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(x, y, 'b-', linewidth=2)
plt.title('Sine Wave')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('sin(x)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

## Getting Started

If you're interested in creating your own Quarto blog, check out the [official documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html) to get started.

Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for more posts!
